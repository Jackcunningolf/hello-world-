# Hello_World!

My first repository.
 
Hi, my name is Jack Cunningham and I attend Robert A. Millikan High School as a senior. 
I will attend Boise State University in the fall of 2019 as a computer science major. 
I plan to snowboard a lot during my stay for four years in Idaho. 

Hello again! My name is Jack Cunningham and I attend Boise State University as
a computer science major currently in my junior year. I have snowboarded a lot, but I've ran into an issue I don't want to talk about.... Anyway, I have learned so much my time here and this is me reflecting on what I've learned. From getting a 1 on the AP computer science test to getting As in my cs classes, the transformation has been pretty sweet. I plan on immersing myself into the world of cybersecurity when the time comes.
